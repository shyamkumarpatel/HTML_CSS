        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>
            My career aspirations are to build upon my consulting and technical foundations until I can take on the responsibilities of a Solutions Architect (SA) within the life sciences domain. Mainly, I want to focus on helping streamline the drug discovery and development process to determine the viability of molecular compounds for treatment or therapeutic uses. This process currently takes years and is ripe for disruption.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a SA, I can help by being a liaison between business teams, Pharma Scientists, and technical teams. Often, SA translate the functional requirement into technical requirement and support the entire Software Development Life Cycle for delivering apt solutions.
