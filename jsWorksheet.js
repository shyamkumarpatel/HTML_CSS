// What is a variable?




// Make me a variable called name and put your name as the value




// Make me a variable called age and put your age as the value




// Pretend it's your birthday and add 1 to your age




// Make me a variable called isStudent and set the value to true




// What do we call the variable type I just had you make?




// What is a conditional statement and why are they handy?




// Write me a conditional statement that checks if your age is under 25. If it is, print "Wow, you're pretty young!" if it's not, print "Age = wisdom"




// Write me a conditional statement that checks if you are a student. If you are, print "Good on you for learning to code!"




// The great == or === debate
// == checks for equality but does NOT account for type
// === checks for equality and DOES account for type
// ex:
if(7 == "7"){
    // This would be true with the double equal because the value is 7
}

if(7 === "7"){
    // This would NOT run because an integer is NOT the same thing as a string
}

if(isStudent){
    console.log("Good on you for learning to code!");
}

// {} -> curly braces
// [] -> square brackets




// Write a for loop that starts at 0, ends at 10, and increments up by 1. Inside the loop, print the value of i




// Now write me a for loop that starts at 20, ends at 1, and decrements by 2. Inside the loop, print the value of i




// Make me an array with the values [3,7,10,2,4,18]




// Pop quiz: what index value do arrays ALWAYS start on?




// Pop quiz: if I wanted to grab the 2nd value in an array, how would I write that?




// Pop quiz: how would I grab the LAST value in an array?




// Push the value 5 into the array you made




// Quick question: how would I REMOVE a value from the back?




// Write me a for loop that traverses through the array from before and prints the values at each index




// Now add to that loop some logic that checks if the value is greater than 5 and ONLY print the value if it is larger than 5




// Function time! Tell me what a function is and why we use them?




// If I write function doAThing(value)...what is the term we use for that "value" inside the parentheses?




// Write me a function that, when called, prints out "Hello there!"




// Now add the ability for the function to accept a name and print out 




// Quick! Tell me the coolest thing you've learned this week!




// What are you most proud of yourself for figuring out this week?




// Are you excited to learn more?




// What can we do to make your time with us even better?
